# FIN_MANAGER_FRONTEND

This is a frontend application made with Vue.js to handle user authentication alongside income and expenses transactions. The backend service for this application can be found on my github profile.



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:FelipeBulhoes/fin_manager_frontend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd fin_manager_frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn  |  npm install
```

Run (dev mode)

```bash
  yarn dev | npm run dev
```

Also you can lint with ESlint
```bash
  yarn lint | npm run lint
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:5173

(Attention) Make sure the backend is running on port 8000 as the frontend app is configured to access this port.
